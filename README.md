# gas-send-form-files-to-tg

## Overview
The Google Apps Script allows sending Google Forms' attached files to Telegram chats. It is useful when you need to have files available in Telegram rather than Google Drive after a form submission.

The project skeleton was obtained from the repository https://github.com/enuchi/React-Google-Apps-Script. 
(Some cleanup of unused items such as extra packages, unused files, and tests is still required)
